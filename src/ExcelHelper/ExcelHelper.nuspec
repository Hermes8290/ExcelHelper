    <description>A library for reading and writing Excel files. Extremely fast, flexible, and easy to use.</description>
    <summary>A library for reading and writing Excel files. Extremely fast, flexible, and easy to use. The primary purpose of this library is to support reading Excel files into Plain Old C# Objects (POCO's) with a high performance parser for converting the records from Excel intil C# objects. Supports reading and writing of custom class objects. Supports reading Excel files in all formats including the newer OpenXML formats as well as the older binary BIFF8 and BIFF5 formats using the awesome ExcelDataReader project. Supports writing XML files only in the OpenXML format using the awesome ClosedXML library.</summary>
    <releaseNotes>Changed ExcelReader to use ExcelDataReader which will support all Excel files including the older BIFF8 and early binary formats, as well as OpenXML format files. Reader is probably faster as the ExcelDataReader library is a lightweight library intended just for reading the data so ignores all the formatting information so is perfect for our use.</releaseNotes>
